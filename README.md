Accuracy of 1st lstm basic model is above 90% because of overfitting then we tried the same model in much bigger dataset
and the model does not learn on it because of lemitization basics and accuracy riches at most 4% in predicting next word.

GPT-2 Distill pretrained model and Large LSTM are not included in this repository, because of size limit. 
So both of them are availible in Drive. All three files inside final folder whould be located in Models/Transformers.
large_LSTM should be located in Trained Folder.

All packages used are inside `requirements.txt`. In order to install, write `pip install to-requirements.txt`.
